1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?
--> Function is a set of statements and perform specific task. By using function, code can be reused and it can run multiple times to perform the task.


2. When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?
--> function will run when it is called.


3. What statement creates a function?
--> def keyword is used to create function. 
function is created as follows:

def function_name(arg1,arg2,...)

function_name is name of the function specified after the def keyword followed by space.
function will have arguments and it will be specified within parenthesis.

4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?
--> Function is a group of statements to perform specific task.
Function call is an expression that invokes the function by providing the required parameters.

5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?
--> Global scope: There is only one global scope per program execution and this scope remains in existence until the program terminates.
Local scope: Local scope is a block of code or body of function and variable defined inside this block of code will not be accessible outside the function.

6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?
--> The variables in the local scope will be undefined or disappear when the function call returns.

7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?
--> Return statement is used inside the function and it returns the result to the function caller. Return statement end the execution of function.
Return value can be specified in an expression, if no expression is specified then none is returned from the function.

8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?
--> None (null value) is returned from the function when the function does not have a return statement.

9. How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?
--> global keyword is used to refer to the global variable.

10. What is the data type of None?
--> Datatype of None is NoneType and it is used to define null value to the variable.

11. What does the sentence import areallyourpetsnamederic do?
--> If there is no module created with the name areallyourpetsnamederic then Module Not find error will be thrown.
If there is module areallyourpetsnamederic created, then it all the functions defined inside this module can be accessed.


12. If you had a bacon() feature in a spam module, what would you call it after importing spam?
--> spam.bacon() is used to call bacon() function defined inside spam module.

13. What can you do to save a programme from crashing if it encounters an error?
--> Exception handling can be used to save a program from crashing when it encounters an error.

14. What is the purpose of the try clause? What is the purpose of the except clause?
--> In try clause, code will be written to perform some operation, purpose of try block is used to check for errors.
When there is a error in the try block then code inside the except clause will execute and raise the exception.
